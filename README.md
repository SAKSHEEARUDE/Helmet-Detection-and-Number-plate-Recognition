<h1>Helmet detection and Number Plate Recognition </h1>
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for detecting helmets and recognizing number plates in real-time from video feeds or images. The goal is to enhance road safety by identifying riders without helmets and automating the process of number plate recognition for law enforcement.
