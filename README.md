<h1>Helmet detection and Number Plate Recognition </h1>
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for detecting helmets and recognizing number plates in real-time from video feeds or images. The goal is to enhance road safety by identifying riders without helmets and automating the process of number plate recognition for law enforcement.

## Overview
This project combines computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to detect helmets on riders and recognize number plates from video feeds. The system can be used in various applications including traffic monitoring and enforcement.
